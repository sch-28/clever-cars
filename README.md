# Teaching a car how to drive
An older Project of mine. Be aware that the user interface is german.

Try it out: https://sch-28.github.io/clever-cars/ 

Hold LMB in the Canvas on the left side to draw a road for the cars. Make sure that the curves are not too sharp.
The cars will try to solve the track over multiple generations using my implementation of neuroevolution.
